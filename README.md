# hons-proj-app

The first React Native app I ever made for a university project using Expo.

Yes, it's in JS and not TS. I barely knew any JS (nor anything about mobile app development) when writing this, and it shows.

The two backend services `hons-proj-api` and `hons-proj-ilp` support this project. The former is the REST API, while the latter generates and steps through the flight path of the "drone".


## Features

- A mobile app for placing food orders that a fictional drone will deliver to your current location (if it is on the university campus).
- Provides the ability to track an order's current location in real-time as it's being delivered by the "drone".
- Delivers status updates using Expo's push notification service.
- Uses cross platform APIs and should (theoretically) run on iOS as well as Android.


## Demo
